\textbf{Till Now} We are developing a learning model for video module part where we have achieved 30\% of accuracy.\newline

During this research we  estimated that the data model we are using can achieve an accuracy more than 65\% after a training of 20+ hours with training.\newline

In audio module, we discovered that there are some data sets that we can use to compare and analyse pitch value and frequency metric of audio files and hence can sense about the behaviour of a  person in that snap of time.
